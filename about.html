                    <p>We are a new San Francisco-based arts & culture magazine. We do not believe it is a risky time to start a printed magazine, instead we believe that right now, this very moment, more than ever, is the perfect time to showcase our generation. As we move farther ahead technologically we simultaneously find our hearts back paddling towards more classic, simpler lines of communication. Somewhere between microwave dinners and mp3 players, convenience became inconvenient for inspiration. At least to some of us.</p> 
                    <p>We are artists, writers, photographers and designers all carrying the common thread of appreciation for those who are out there making positive contributions to the creative underground. We got tired of seeing talent reach only those, like us, who were lucky enough to stumble upon it, and have decided that it’s time to give us all a more cohesive voice. As opposed to other major metropolises, San Francisco’s lack of media saturation, paired with an overflowing creative urban population has reached a crescendo. The aftermath is a untapped pool of talent, dedicated to their art with little expectation for more than personal reward.</p> 
                    <p>In an effort to translate our experiences to the page, we bring you YesYesYes: an identity and an informant of the lifestyle we are so lucky to be a part of. What you will find inside won’t be streamlined or homogeneous. We aim to give voice to the rawest, most hilarious and most incomparable creative people we can find. It is through these connections that we have spun a web of weirdness and beauty that covers the country. We hope to include you.</p>
